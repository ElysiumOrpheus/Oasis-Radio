done - status shows its connecting/retrying sometimes but in reality the log says the recording session just finished
done - i want it to only delete the transcriptions and audio if thers no hit. i want it to send a message with the bot if thers not a hit or if theres a hit. but only pinging if there is a hit.
commands sent to discord bot during whisper model loadin are very slow
